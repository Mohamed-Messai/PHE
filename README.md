# PHE
This is a simple implementation to demonstrate 3 notable Partially homomorphic encryption (PHE): El-Gamal, RSA and Paillier encryption.

# El-Gamal encryption
 El-Gamal encryption system is a widely-used homomorphic encryption (HE) in public-key
 cryptography, proposed by T. ElGamal in 1985. The advent
 of El-Gamal algorithm is based on the Diffieâ€“Hellman key exchange, 
 while its security strength is relied on the hardness
 of solving discrete logarithms. 

 El-Gamal cryptosystem is known as a Partial Homomorphic Encryption (PHE), 
 which allows to operate only homomorphic multiplications on ciphertexts.
 This is a simple demonstration of how it works.
 
 # Paillier encryption
 The encryption of Paillier (1999) is an additively homomorphic cryptosystem, 
which is based on the composite residuosity problem 
and gathers many good properties.

This is a simple demonstration of Paillier homomorphic encryption, 
well known as a Partial Homomorphic Encryption (PHE)
Here we attempts to show the basic mathematical operations
that can be performed on both ciphertexts and plaintexts.

 # RSA encryption
 RSA was first introduced by Rivest et al. in 1978. 
The security of the cryptosystem relies on the practical hardness of
factoring the product of two large prime numbers, called the factoring problem. 

In homomorphic encryption (HE), RSA is the first Partial Homomorphic Encryption (PHE)
and commonly used in practice. Compared to other HE schemes such as Paillier and El-Gamal,
RSA is much easier. Here we demonstrate a simple program of RSA 
and its multiplicatively homomorphic properties.
